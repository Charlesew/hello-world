First Task
Hi Everybody
I have been around computers since I can remember.   My Dad was one of the first 3 peoplpe in my country with a Computing Ingeneer degree.   Our firts computer used the 16' floppy disks and the first game we played was called Robots,  my dad was very excited when he got the flight simulator, probably baceuse he was a pilot.
